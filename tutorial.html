  <div class="stackedit__html"><h1 id="tutorial-on-how-to-get-unban-on-valorant">Tutorial on how to get unban on valorant</h1>
<p>Setup:</p>
<ul>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled=""> A USB in FAT 16/32 format, and at least 1GB of storage  (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_8W-CPcMEs">tutorial</a>  | <em>we need it to flash the bios xD</em> | <strong>WILL DELETE ALL OF YOUR DATA ON THAT USB SO BE CAREFUL</strong>)</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled=""> <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/3wpfkw2wgq0gfua/HWID_Reset_Tools.zip/file">HWID unbanner tools</a></li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked="true" disabled=""> You reading this on another device like your phone xD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 1. Unintstall Val and Vanguard but <em>not by settings or control panel</em></strong><br>
download the <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/3wpfkw2wgq0gfua/HWID_Reset_Tools.zip/file">hwid unban tool things</a>, then unzip the tools in your desktop. then open up the folder named <code>RevoUninstaller</code> or some shit like that, then open up <code>RevoUPort.exe</code> and then search for Valorant and after uninstalling valorant by scanning in an advanced way and selecting everything and deleting all the things left to leave no trace of val on ur pc, do the same shit for vanguard.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. flash your bios</strong><br>
Valorant uses bios information to ban you from hardware id, you can bypass that by flashing your bios aka updating it to a newer version and stuff. go to <a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy/download">www.ccleaner.com/speccy</a> then download the <em>free</em> version of the tool. Next when you open the app press on <code>Motherboard</code> to find your motherboard model:</p>

then after that copy your motherboard model number:<br>
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/917964085923045439/1054194875349868604/image.png" alt="image of motherboard model"></p>
<p>par la suite, you search it up on google and you will find your motherboard company website and try to find the motherboard download.<br>
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/917964085923045439/1054196416660115526/image.png" alt="example firmware"><br>
then on the usb youve formatted to fat32, put the bios files that you have extracted from downloads and into desktop, into the usb file.</p>
<p>Then go to bios settings, either you go press the <code>⊞Windows</code> key and press on the power button and press shift while you are pressing on <code>↺ Restart</code> and keep pressing shift untill a blue screen with options appears then press the advanced options:<br>
<img src="https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/f4fde1b8-7b3d-ac4e-6d6c-5339925fb04c.png" alt="Advanced options"><br>
and then press on <code>UEFI Firmware Settings</code>:<br>
<img src="https://windows.do/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/f02xx07.png" alt="Quickly Repair a Non-Booting PC in Windows 10 – windows.do"><br>
Then you will be entered into <em>UEFI</em> aka Bios 2.0</p>
<p><strong>ALSO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN UPDATING BIOS, WITHOUT BIOS YOUR COMPUTER IS NOT GOING TO WORK AT ALL  (<em>unless you get a replacement of it ofc</em>)</strong></p>
<p>from there you can search on youtube about how to flash your bios on your motherboard :)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Change your hardware serial number</strong></p>
<p><strong>WARNING: YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KEEP YOUR SERIAL NUMBER SOMEWHERE IN A NOTEBOOK OR SOMETHING SO THAT IF YOU HAVE A COMPUTER TECHNICIAN LOOK AT YOUR COMPUTER AND LIKE SWAP PARTS, TELL HIM THAT YOUR COMPUTER WAS LIKE PREDONE AND THE COMPANIE SAID THAT THOSES NUMBERS WERE THE ORIGINAL SERIAL BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED AND ITS NOW CHANGED</strong></p>
<p>Now finaly you can change the serial numbers of the drives, open <code>HardDisk.exe</code> as <code>🛡ADMINISTRATOR</code> and then come up with a random serial number as long as it this long: XXXX-XXXX</p>
<p>For instance you can do:<br>
<code>A8D2-7D1E</code> or idk lol</p>
<p>Then open up the <code>GRINX64v2</code> Folder and run <code>DMIEDIT.EXE</code> and then follow the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrBSzAYiC88&amp;t=135">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrBSzAYiC88&amp;t=135</a><br>
and stuff untill you finished changing all of the macs and stuff</p>
<p><strong>REMEMBER TRY TO CHANGE ALL OF THEM, SOME OF THEM DONT GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO CHANGE SO DONT WORRY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Restart your computer</strong><br>
pretty self explanitory, to apply the hardware serial number change to the computer :/</p>
<p><strong>Step 5. Extra security mesures</strong><br>
download this batch file and open it with <code>🛡ADMINISTRATOR</code> permissions. it will delete all of your log files, just in case riot games stores that for some dumb reason: <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/e8ktkj7zcru60mf/Delete_Log_Files.bat/file">https://www.mediafire.com/file/e8ktkj7zcru60mf/Delete_Log_Files.bat/file</a></p>
<p>then press <code>⊞Windows</code> + <code>R</code> to open run. From there type: “cmd”<br>
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/917964085923045439/1054216681741897768/image.png" alt="command line in run"><br>
After opening cmd, Type: <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code> and press enter. And this is what it should look like:<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/917964085923045439/1054217066833530980/image.png" alt="successful dns flush"><br>
<em>flushdns is a command that deletes all of your internet traffic history on your dns</em></p>
<p>FINALY, clear all of the cookies in google chrome and as well remove all of the host cache by typing: <strong>chrome://net-internals/#dns</strong> in your url address bar typing thing and press on the button to really make sure that riot is a weirdo and is very strict with your hardware id ban :/</p>
<p>Annd that should be it! What has changed with your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bios Version</li>
<li>Serial Number with your parts</li>
<li>Basically nothing else</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for coming to my ted talk :)</p>
